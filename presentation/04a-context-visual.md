# Two Types of Context

## Information Context
**What the AI Knows** (Passive)

- Code files
- Documentation
- Previous messages
- Test results
- Browser snapshots

## Capability Context
**What the AI Can Do** (Active)

- Commands
- Skills (SpecSwarm workflows)
- Tools (MCP servers)
- Subagents (specialists)
- Scripts and procedures
