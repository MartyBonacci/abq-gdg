# Why This Matters

AI doesn't hide communication gaps.

It **exposes** them.

---

When AI "doesn't understand," it's often because:
- We can't fully articulate what we envision
- We see the end goal but not all the steps
- We're missing details we didn't know we needed

This isn't an AI problem.

**It's a human problem.**

The solution?

**Better context stacking + iteration**

This is why the Mentor Mind pattern works.
