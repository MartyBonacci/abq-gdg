# Context Stacking

## The Core Principle

**The model only knows what's in its context window.**

That's it. That's the whole game.

## How Every AI Tool Works

Whether it's:
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- ChatGPT
- Claude Code
- Windsurf
- Literally anything

They all run on the same principle:

**Stack the right context → Get better output**

---

## What Is Context?

Context is everything the AI can "see" when it generates a response:

- The current file you're editing
- Files you've opened recently
- Your prompt
- Previous messages in the conversation
- Documentation it fetched
- Code it read from your project
- Test results it saw
- Browser snapshots it took

**More relevant context = better results.**

## The Tools Are Just Context Strategies

| Tool | Context Strategy |
|------|------------------|
| GitHub Copilot | Autocomplete based on nearby code |
| Cursor | Add files to context with `@file` |
| ChatGPT | Copy/paste code manually |
| Claude Code | Reads files, runs commands, sees full repo |
| Agentic tools | Multi-step context building over time |

They're not magic. They're **context engines**.

## Why This Matters

If you understand context stacking, you can:
- Get better results from ANY tool
- Debug why an AI gave a bad answer (wrong context)
- Design better prompts (stack the context you need)
- Build your own workflows (like the Mentor Mind pattern)

You're not learning tools. You're learning **how to feed the machine**.

## The Question Isn't "Which Tool?"

The question is:

**"How do I get the right context into the window?"**

Once you know that, the tool doesn't matter.
