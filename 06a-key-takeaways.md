# Three Things to Remember

## 1. The Expressibility Gap is Human, Not AI

We can't fully articulate what we envision.

This isn't a bug — it's how cognition works.

AI tools that demand complete upfront specs are fighting reality.

## 2. Context Stacking = Information + Capability + Cascade

**Information**: What the AI knows (files, docs, messages)

**Capability**: What the AI can do (skills, tools, subagents)

**Cascade**: Each capability brings its own methodology

You're not just feeding the machine. You're equipping it.

## 3. Mentor Mind Makes It Practical

**Two instances** → Different perspectives

**One sees more** → Strategic prompts

**One does more** → Focused execution

Start tonight: 2 terminals, 1 prompt template, instant results.
