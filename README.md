## What This Is

This repo is the presentation. Follow along live, or use it later as a reference.

Tonight I'm building an app from scratch using Claude Code while we talk through *why* it works — not just the tools, but the underlying principle that makes AI coding actually useful.

---

## Before We Start

If you want to code along, get these set up:

1. [Claude Code Setup](00-setup/claude-code.md)
2. [SpecSwarm Plugin](00-setup/specswarm.md)
3. [Chrome DevTools MCP](00-setup/chrome-devtools.md)

No worries if you just want to watch — you'll still walk away with the concepts.
